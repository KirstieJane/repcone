## What are we doing?
---

### The problem
- Guidelines for adopting reproducible research practices are usually not tailored for the type of project and the field that will implement them.
- We are lacking a quantitative analysis of the use of reproducible research practices in Cognitive Computational Neuroscience (CCN) projects, and of their subsequent transparency and reusability.
- The majority of guides for reproducible research do not provide ready to use templates that facilitate the adoption of these practices.

### Our solution
- Document online the best practices for conducting reproducible research in CCN, taking into account the needs of the different types of modeling projects.
- Create a report quantifying the use of reproducible research practices in CCN projects.
- Provide templates and other practical tools for conducting reproducible research in CCN.


## Who are we?
---
This project is carried out in collaboration with [The Turing Way](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way) community. 


## What do we need?
---
**You** can help us by:

* Suggesting, adding or discussing content for our guidelines
* Mantaining and/or improving the infrastructure of our online guide and report
* Joining our efforts to quantify the use of reproducibility practices
* Working in the development of our reproducibility templates
* Assist in the organization of events
* Giving feedback on the ways we can improve and the things we did good!
